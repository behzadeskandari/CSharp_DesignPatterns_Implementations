//The Abstract Factory pattern is used to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
//This pattern is particularly useful when you need to create objects that are part of a larger system and have variations or multiple implementations based on a certain theme or context.
//Let's continue with our ERP system example and demonstrate how the Abstract Factory pattern can be applied in the front-end using a detailed example.
//Example: Creating a Theme - based Employee Dashboard
//In an ERP system, you might have different themes for the user interface, and each theme could have its own set of UI components.We'll use the Abstract Factory pattern to create employee dashboard components based on the selected theme.
// Abstract Factory
class DashboardComponentFactory {
    createHeader() { }
    createSidebar() { }
    createEmployeeList() { }
}

// Concrete Factory for Light Theme
class LightThemeFactory extends DashboardComponentFactory {
    createHeader() {
        return new LightThemeHeader();
    }

    createSidebar() {
        return new LightThemeSidebar();
    }

    createEmployeeList() {
        return new LightThemeEmployeeList();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory for Dark Theme
class DarkThemeFactory extends DashboardComponentFactory {
    createHeader() {
        return new DarkThemeHeader();
    }

    createSidebar() {
        return new DarkThemeSidebar();
    }

    createEmployeeList() {
        return new DarkThemeEmployeeList();
    }
}

// Abstract Product: Header
class Header {
    render() { }
}

// Concrete Products for Light Theme
class LightThemeHeader extends Header {
    render() {
        console.log("Rendering light theme header...");
    }
}

// Concrete Products for Dark Theme
class DarkThemeHeader extends Header {
    render() {
        console.log("Rendering dark theme header...");
    }
}

// Similarly, define Sidebar and EmployeeList classes for different themes...

// Client Code
function createEmployeeDashboard(theme) {
    let factory;

    switch (theme.toLowerCase()) {
        case "light":
            factory = new LightThemeFactory();
            break;
        case "dark":
            factory = new DarkThemeFactory();
            break;
        default:
            throw new Error(`Unsupported theme: ${theme}`);
    }

    const header = factory.createHeader();
    const sidebar = factory.createSidebar();
    const employeeList = factory.createEmployeeList();

    return { header, sidebar, employeeList };
}

// Usage
const lightThemeDashboard = createEmployeeDashboard("light");
lightThemeDashboard.header.render();
lightThemeDashboard.sidebar.render();
lightThemeDashboard.employeeList.render();

const darkThemeDashboard = createEmployeeDashboard("dark");
darkThemeDashboard.header.render();
darkThemeDashboard.sidebar.render();
darkThemeDashboard.employeeList.render();


///In this example, we have an abstract DashboardComponentFactory that defines methods for creating header, sidebar, and employee list components. 
//Concrete factories(LightThemeFactory and DarkThemeFactory) implement these methods to create components based on the selected theme.
//Each theme has its own set of concrete components(LightThemeHeader, DarkThemeHeader, etc.) that extend the Header, Sidebar, and EmployeeList abstract classes.
///The Abstract Factory pattern allows you to create entire families of related objects(components) based on a theme(context) without tightly coupling the client code to specific implementations.
//This is beneficial in an ERP system where you might want to offer different user interface experiences based on user preferences or requirements.
//Keep in mind that this example focuses on the Abstract Factory pattern itself, and an ERP system would involve more complex interactions and features between different UI components and backend systems.
