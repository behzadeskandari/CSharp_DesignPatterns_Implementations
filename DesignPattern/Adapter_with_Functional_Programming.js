//n a functional programming style, you can create an adapter using higher-order functions and function composition.
//Let's explore a detailed example of using the Adapter design pattern in a pure JavaScript front-end ERP system, following a modular functional programming approach, to integrate a currency conversion service using DOM manipulation.
//Example: Currency Conversion Adapter with Functional Programming and DOM Manipulation
//
//In this example, we'll create an adapter using functional programming concepts to integrate a currency conversion service into an ERP system


// External currency conversion service (third-party library or API)
const currencyConverterService = {
    convert: (amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency) => {
        // Simulated conversion logic (could involve API requests)
        const exchangeRate = 1.2; // Assuming 1 unit of fromCurrency = 1.2 units of toCurrency
        return amount * exchangeRate;
    },
};

// Adapter: Currency Converter Adapter
const currencyConverterAdapter = (converter) => (amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency) => {
    const convertedAmount = converter.convert(amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency);
    return convertedAmount;
};

// Client Code
const convertButton = document.getElementById('convert-btn');
convertButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const amountElement = document.getElementById('amount');
    const fromCurrencyElement = document.getElementById('from-currency');
    const toCurrencyElement = document.getElementById('to-currency');
    const resultElement = document.getElementById('conversion-result');

    const amount = parseFloat(amountElement.value);
    const fromCurrency = fromCurrencyElement.value;
    const toCurrency = toCurrencyElement.value;

    const convertCurrency = currencyConverterAdapter(currencyConverterService);
    const convertedAmount = convertCurrency(amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency);

    resultElement.textContent = `${amount} ${fromCurrency} = ${convertedAmount.toFixed(2)} ${toCurrency}`;
});


//currencyConverterService: Represents an external currency conversion service(simulated here) that has a different interface than what we need in our ERP system.
//currencyConverterAdapter: The adapter function that takes the external currency converter and adapts it to match the expected functional programming style.
//Client code: Sets up event listeners to handle currency conversion requests from the user, uses the adapter to convert currencies using functional programming concepts, and updates the DOM with the conversion result.
//By using functional programming concepts, you create a more modular and composable adapter that can be easily integrated into your ERP system.Functional programming promotes a declarative and reusable approach,
//which is valuable when adapting external services or libraries.
///In a real ERP system, you could apply the functional programming approach to integrate other external services, handle data transformations, or encapsulate complex interactions in a more modular and readable manner.
