//The Visitor design pattern is used to separate an algorithm from the object structure it operates on. In the context of a front-end ERP system, you might use the Visitor pattern to perform operations on various elements of the UI without modifying their classes.

//Let's explore a detailed example of using the Visitor design pattern in a pure JavaScript front-end ERP system to implement a visitor that performs calculations on different items in a shopping cart with DOM manipulation.

//Example: Shopping Cart Calculation with Visitor Pattern and DOM Manipulation

//In this example, we'll create a visitor that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart and updates the DOM accordingly.

// Visitor: CartVisitor
class CartVisitor {
    visitProduct(product) {
        console.log(`Visiting product: ${product.name}`);
        return product.price;
    }

    visitDiscount(discount) {
        console.log(`Visiting discount: ${discount.description}`);
        return -discount.amount;
    }
}

// Visitable Elements
class Product {
    constructor(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    accept(visitor) {
        return visitor.visitProduct(this);
    }
}

class Discount {
    constructor(description, amount) {
        this.description = description;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    accept(visitor) {
        return visitor.visitDiscount(this);
    }
}

// Client Code
const cart = [
    new Product('Widget', 10),
    new Product('Gadget', 20),
    new Discount('Promo Code', 5)
];

const visitor = new CartVisitor();

let totalCost = 0;

for (const item of cart) {
    totalCost += item.accept(visitor);
}

const totalElement = document.getElementById('total-cost');
totalElement.textContent = `Total Cost: $${totalCost.toFixed(2)}`;





///CartVisitor: The visitor class that defines operations to be performed on different elements of the shopping cart.
//Visitable Elements(Product, Discount): The elements that accept the visitor and implement the accept method.
//Client code: Creates a shopping cart with products and discounts, calculates the total cost using the visitor, and updates the DOM to display the result.
//By using the Visitor pattern, you can perform operations on different types of objects without modifying their classes.
//This is useful in an ERP system where you might have various elements in the UI that require different kinds of processing or calculations.
//In a real ERP system, you could apply the Visitor pattern to scenarios such as performing different types of data validation, processing orders, or generating reports for various types of data
